Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21M.380 Music and Technology: Sound Design_ as it was taught by Dr. Florian Hollerweger in Spring 2016.

In this course, students learned how to build sounds and sound effects from scratch, using the open-source graphical programming environment [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) (Pd). They also learned how to analyze and synthesize sounds and encapsulate them in dynamic sound objects that can be embedded into computer games animations, movies, virtual environments, sound installations, and theater productions. Their work was guided by Andy Farnell’s book _Designing Sound_.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

1.  Reflect upon and analyze everyday sonic experiences and articulate them to others.
2.  Design and implement computer music applications using essential sound synthesis and programming techniques.
3.  Identify suitable synthesis techniques to develop a design strategy for a specific sound design problem.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

This course prepares students for projects and further study in games, film/video, theater, music, and other fields that employ sound.
